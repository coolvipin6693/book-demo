            "I read this book around 2-3 years back. I was thrilled by the beauty of the revelations it suggested. I tried doing what the book suggested. The garden, the lighthouse, the sumo wrestler, the pink wire cable, the stopwatch, the roses and the winding path of diamonds - the seven timeless virtues, which will give you an enlightened life.", 
            "The book definitely has many useful techniques which can help to improve our lives at every level. But we are not living in Himalayas & not everyone is willing to leave the material things for wisdom, so not every technique is practical for an average person.",
